**Description**
1st-place STEMSprint 2021 hackathon submission.
A pygame to learn about sustainable waste management!

In the near future, a dude has to whack incoming domestic Garbage into the right bin. When Garbage is not recycled or handled properly, the waste piles up around him. The non-recyclable Garbage is whacked into the black bin where it slowly accumulates and will one day take over the world. Thus, it is important to reduce the spawn of this type of Garbage. The recyclable Garbage can be whacked into their respective bin types, which allows the dude to continue whacking Garbage forever. The dude continues his journey of whacking away Garbage to be recycled, while the impending doom of world-domination of non-recyclable Garbage harbours deep in his thoughts. 


**Installation**
pip3 install pygame

**CONTROLS**
N key - changes bat direction to NORTH (CONTAINERS BIN) 
E key - changes bat direction to EAST (MIXED PAPERS BIN)
S key - changes bat direction to SOUTH (LANDFILL BIN)
W key - changes bat direction to WEST (COMPOST BIN)
SPACE BAR - hit the bat, which also RESETS the direction

*default bat direction is north, and resets to north with each bat swing. The player must set a new direction before each swing of the bat.

Garbage of different types will spawn and fly towards the player. The player must choose a direction and swing the bat to hit the garbage into its corresponding bin.

The garbage and their corresponding bins are as follows:
